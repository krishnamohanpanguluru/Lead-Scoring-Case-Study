# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
This case study is to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a lead is successfully converted or not.

**Problem Statement**

This problem statement belongs to an education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. 

 Many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and  browse for courses. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google.

 Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. 

 Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. 

**Business Goal:**

X Education needs to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. 

 The company needs to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. 

The CEO, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.


**Approach & Methodology**

The following approach is followed to perform Lead Score Case study using Logistic Regression :

1.  Understanding the data domain /Variables by referring to the Data Dictionary.

2.  We have been given a Leads dataset to perform the analysis.

3.  The analysis is performed by importing Leads dataset.

4.  Data Cleaning is performed by analyzing(EDA) and then dropping the features that are not reliable. This is performed based on the following steps:

    -  Handling the ‘select’ level that is present in many of the categorical variables by replacing with ‘NaN’ values 
    -  Dropping columns that are having high percentage of missing values by checking all the columns before dropping them
    -  Dealing with the unique categories in the categorical features
5.  Data preparation is performed on the following steps:

    -  Creating Dummy variables  for categorical features
    -  Perform train – test split (70 : 30)
    -  Scaling the Numeric features using ‘StandardScaler’

6. Building Logistic Regression Model by performing the following techniques on Train data :

    -  Initiating the first logistic Model Using the ‘GLM’ method of ‘statsmodel’ library 
    -  Automatic Feature Selection using RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) 
    -  The model is being iterated until the features coefficients are significant based on the P-value <  0.05 and VIF < 5

7.  Performing Evaluation metrices on the train data :
    -  Confusion Matrix and Accuracy
    -  Sensitivity and Specificity
    -  Plotting ROC curve
    -  Precision and Recall

8.  Predicting on the Test data
9.  Evaluation Metrices on the Test data
10.  Lead Scoring is performed on the train and test data based on the probabilities obtained

**Conclusions**

1.  After Building the model, we have performed evaluation metrics on both train and test data. Checked based on the Sensitivity and Specificity as well as Precision and Recall. We have considered the optimal cutoff based on Sensitivity and Specificity for calculating the final predictions.
2.   On the train dataset, for the optimal threshold of 0.3 we got the sensitivity or Recall as 91.65 % while the optimal cutoff chosen as 0.7 we got the sensitivity or Recall as 80.74 %.
3.   On the test dataset, for the optimal threshold of 0.3 we got the sensitivity or Recall as 92.32 % while the optimal cutoff chosen as 0.7 we got the sensitivity or Recall as 80.42 %.
4.   Also the lead score calculated shows the conversion rate on the final predicted model is around 80% in train and test set
5.  The top 3 variables that contribute for lead getting converted in the model are
    -  Total Time Spent on Website
    -  Lead Origin_Lead Add Form
    -  Lead Source_Olark Chat
 6.  Based on the above summary of model prediction and evaluation it was concluded that this model seems to be good with good sensitivity or recall as satisfies our requirement.
